It encourages active listening, empathy, and support for one another's successes and challenges. Additionally, "Catch Up Fridays" can serve as a platform for students to practice communication skills, build confidence, and develop social-emotional competencies in a supportive environment. Overall, it's a fun and inclusive way to wrap up the week and set a positive tone for the days ahead.</p>
