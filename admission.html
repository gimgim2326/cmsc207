        <h3>Alternative Learning System (ALS)</h3>
        <p>
          The school also offers the Alternative Learning System (ALS), a program designed to provide a different way of learning for Out-of-School Youth
           and Adults (OSYA) who haven't finished 10 years of basic education as required by the Philippine Constitution.
            This program helps those who left school early to complete their elementary and secondary education outside the traditional school system. 
            The updated version 2.0 of ALS focuses on helping OSYA learners gain essential literacy skills and providing them with ways to finish their basic education.
